## Energy_Prediction
### PROBLEM STATEMENT
#### The rising demand for energy, coupled with the global shift toward sustainable resources, presents a critical need for accurate forecasting of energy consumption. This project aims to create a machine learning model that can predict energy consumption using various global indicators. The goal is to support informed decisions on energy planning and sustainable resource management.

### Objective
#### The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting global energy consumption patterns using available data from various countries and years. This prediction will help governments and organizations better manage energy resources and optimize the use of sustainable energy sources.

#### The data for this project is sourced from a global dataset on sustainable energy.
#### This dataset includes information on various energy metrics across multiple countries, covering parameters like energy consumption, production, renewable energy usage, and other relevant socio-economic indicators.

#### Dataset : The dataset contains 3,649 rows and 21 columns, representing various global energy and economic indicators. Hereâ€™s an overview of some key columns:

#### Entity:The country or region being described.
#### Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption (%) : Percentage of energy from renewable sources in the total consumption.
#### Primary energy consumption per capita (kWh/person): Average energy consumption per capita. 
#### gdp_growth: GDP growth rate. 
#### Renewables (% equivalent primary energy): Percentage of primary energy
#### Latitude : Latitude of the places in degrees.

#### This project successfully developed a machine learning model to predict global energy consumption patterns by leveraging diverse economic, environmental, and energy-related indicators. The methodology involved extensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature selection, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical attributes. The model was trained using various machine learning techniques and evaluated for predictive accuracy, providing meaningful insights into energy usage trends.
